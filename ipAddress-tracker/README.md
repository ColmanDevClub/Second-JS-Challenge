## Instructions

- [X] Research about the [IP Geolocation API by IPify](https://geo.ipify.org/) that will return you a location for a specific ip or domain

- [X] Clone this repository.
- [X] Checkout to the starting-files branch
- [X] Try to mimic the following site ( listed bellow ).
- [X] Make the functional part of the page work, every time a user type a **valid** domain/ip address the map should update to the correct location and the domain details should be displayed on the screen ( like in the preview below ). 
- [X] Make sure to validate the typed input as a correct ip/domain ( hint: try to use regex patterns ).
- [X] (bonus) Think how you can use [Cloudflare current ip trace](https://www.cloudflare.com/cdn-cgi/trace) api that returns you the client ip to your advantage.
